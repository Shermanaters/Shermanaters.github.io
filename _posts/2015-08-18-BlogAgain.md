It is quite hard these days.  
Failed on a confession, job issues, life problem... Well mostly, failed confession.  
Long story short, should never convince myself that this is it. It should be obvious, but it's not.  
Anyway, this is not the purpose of this blog.

From now on, I will work hard, study hard, play hard if I have a chance.  
I will blog as much as I could, to learn, and relearn.

It is quite amazing now that I have a private blog myself and I'm writing it with codes...  

Two things I learn these days while depressing.  

>First: It gets easier. Every day, it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day. That's the hard part. But it does get easier.  

>Second: It is hard and painful for the most of time. The opponent is tough, try not to get beaten up too badly.
