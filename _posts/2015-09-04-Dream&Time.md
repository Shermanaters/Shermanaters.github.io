Had a dream last night, I went back to the U.S. and back to school for some classes. My professor was confused. I don't wanna work in this shit job for the rest of my life. So I came back and recharge myself by taking extra classes. I think I took three classes, and one of them is Manifolds. I forgot the name of the other two classes... But I am sure that none of them can be compare to Manifolds in any degree. I don't even know why I have the gut to take Manifolds... But I did, and so Dr. Frohman had a face that basically said, well you gotta take it, you gotta take it... and since I am teaching, you better be good at it. And thus the class began.

One of my Uncles' gone last week, with a fairly young age. Everyone's sad. My mom, his mom, their brothers & sisters. By what can make one realizes that one's days are numbered, it is better to make them count. Well, I don't know. For a while, people will forget, and relearn again.  

Hate to say it but I was planning to make this blog a techBlog, but I was distracted, and work is quite busy this days.
>I don't have enough TIME...
