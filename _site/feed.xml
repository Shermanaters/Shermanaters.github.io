				<title>Dream & Time</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Had a dream last night, I went back to the U.S. and back to school for some classes. My professor was confused. I don’t wanna work in this shit job for the rest of my life. So I came back and recharge myself by taking extra classes. I think I took three classes, and one of them is Manifolds. I forgot the name of the other two classes… But I am sure that none of them can be compare to Manifolds in any degree. I don’t even know why I have the gut to take Manifolds… But I did, and so Dr. Frohman had a face that basically said, well you gotta take it, you gotta take it… and since I am teaching, you better be good at it. And thus the class began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my Uncles’ gone last week, with a fairly young age. Everyone’s sad. My mom, his mom, their brothers &amp;amp; sisters. By what can make one realizes that one’s days are numbered, it is better to make them count. Well, I don’t know. For a while, people will forget, and relearn again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hate to say it but I was planning to make this blog a techBlog, but I was distracted, and work is quite busy this days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t have enough TIME…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

				<title>AND ONCE AGAIN</title>
				<description>&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.xiami.com/widget/705563_1773601051,_235_346_000000_ffffff_0/multiPlayer.swf&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;235&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; wmode=&quot;opaque&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite hard these days.&lt;br /&gt;
Failed on a confession, job issues, life problem… Well mostly, failed confession.&lt;br /&gt;
Long story short, should never convince myself that this is it. It should be obvious, but it’s not.&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, this is not the purpose of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, I will work hard, study hard, play hard if I have a chance.&lt;br /&gt;
I will blog as much as I could, to learn, and relearn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is quite amazing now that I have a private blog myself and I’m writing it with codes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two things I learn these days while depressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;First: It gets easier. Every day, it gets a little easier. But you gotta do it every day. That’s the hard part. But it does get easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Second: It is hard and painful for the most of time. The opponent is tough, try not to get beaten up too badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
